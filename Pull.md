# git pull 

Similar to a [git push](./PUSH.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository. 
Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local respository. 

This means any commits made that are on the remote respository will be pulled and added to the local repository. 

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name: 
```

git pull origin main

If there is any upstream conncetion established, you can use` git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
