# git init

The `git init` command is used to createan empty git respository. 
If you wanted to create a new directory and initial a git respository, you can do so with the following commands: 
```

mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory 
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./Status.md),
[commit](./Commit.md),
[push]9,/Push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
